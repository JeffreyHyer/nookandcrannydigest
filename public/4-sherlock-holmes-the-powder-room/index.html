    <h1><span class="number">#4</span> Sherlock Holmes: The Powder Room</h1>

    

<p>Given the nature and reputation of Sherlock Holmes one would expect to find many
more examples of hidden rooms and other intriguing nooks and crannies in this
and the subsequent movie but, alas, this is just about all we get. There <em>is</em> a
stereotypical safe behind a picture frame found in Sherlocks&rsquo; office but it comes
and goes so quickly that I didn&rsquo;t see fit to include it here. If you&rsquo;re curious,
you can see it at about minute twenty-eight of the movie (28:45).</p>

<p>We <em>are</em>, however, treated to a dandy of a secret room. As Sherlock investigates
the murder of a man in his bathtub he discovers a secret passageway and subsequent
hidden room that&rsquo;s accessed through a secret door hidden in the wall. The door
is opened with a clever (albeit rather poorly concealed) piece of wooden trim
that adornes the wall. There also appears to be a series of intricate mechanical
operations that occur after triggering the latch that move the door into a position
to be swung open.</p>
