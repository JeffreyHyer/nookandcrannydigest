      <description>This one&amp;rsquo;s a great one but it goes by so quick that if you blink while you&amp;rsquo;re watching the movie you may miss it the first time around. This nook/cranny comes from the movie V for Vendetta (2005). In this scene Evey (Natalie Portman) has fled from the police and has gone to Gordon Deitrich&amp;rsquo;s (Stephen Fry; her friend/boss and a famous/wealthy TV personality) home for refuge. She realizes how this may bring unwanted attention to him and begins to apoligize for coming to him when he reveals his secret &amp;ldquo;relic room&amp;rdquo; and convinces her that she has nothing to worry about.</description>
