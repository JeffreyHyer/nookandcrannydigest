      <description>Let this be a lesson to you. If you&amp;rsquo;re married you should probably invest in a secret weapons cache hidden in or near your home, just in case your significant other turns out to be a hitman/hitwoman.
Joking aside, Mr. and Mrs. Smith hosts a treasure trove of secret rooms and hidden compartments for him and her so whatever your style you&amp;rsquo;ll probably find one that suits you in this movie.</description>
