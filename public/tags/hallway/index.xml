      <description>Given the nature and reputation of Sherlock Holmes one would expect to find many more examples of hidden rooms and other intriguing nooks and crannies in this and the subsequent movie but, alas, this is just about all we get. There is a stereotypical safe behind a picture frame found in Sherlocks&amp;rsquo; office but it comes and goes so quickly that I didn&amp;rsquo;t see fit to include it here. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, you can see it at about minute twenty-eight of the movie (28:45).</description>
