Let his be a lesson to you. If you're married you should probably invest in a
secret weapons cache hidden in or near your home, just in case your significant
other turns out to be a hitman/hitwoman.

Joking aside, *Mr. and Mrs. Smith* hosts a treasure trove of secret rooms and
hidden compartments for him and her so whatever your style you'll probably find
one that suits you in this movie.

Check out the clip below for all the details and the image gallery futher down
will give you a solid overview of all the nooks and crannies.
