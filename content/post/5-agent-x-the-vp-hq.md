You'll have to excuse the melodramatic nature of this one, it's a great hidden
room with an exceptional entrance but it can be a little over-the-top at times.

The video below comes from the pilot episode of Agent X. In it, the newly
appointed Vice President of the United States discovers the secret entrance
to a hidden tunnel and subsequent hidden rooms within her new house.
