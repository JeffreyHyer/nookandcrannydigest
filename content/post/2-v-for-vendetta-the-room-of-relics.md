This one's a great one but it goes by so quick that if you blink while you're
watching the movie you may miss it the first time around. This nook/cranny
comes from the movie *V for Vendetta* (2005). In this scene Evey (Natalie Portman)
has fled from the police and has gone to Gordon Deitrich's (Stephen Fry; her
friend/boss and a famous/wealthy TV personality) home for refuge. She realizes
how this may bring unwanted attention to him and begins to apoligize for coming
to him when he reveals his secret "relic room" and convinces her that she has
nothing to worry about.

Political and social commentary aside, I'm a huge fan of the architecture of
this hidden room. The wood paneling on the interior of the room combined with
the brick as well as the archways is fantastic and the unconventional means of
entry via twisting a particular wine bottle is absolutely brilliant!
